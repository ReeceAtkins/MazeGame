# MazeGame
A dynamic maze game built with **TypeScript** and **React**. Navigate through a procedurally generated maze and collect all required items to win. Move player with arrow keys or WASD.

The program creates a jagged 2D array with a randomized size (within a readonly min/max range) and then recursively carves out a narrow path of at least a specified length.

All grid generation settings can be configured at the top of `Game.ts`.
